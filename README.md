How to measure temperature and humidity

AndrÃ© Lindholm
al225hv

A temperature sensor to measure the temperature in the room. The length of this project varies depending on several factors. For example the code, if you write your own or copy it from someone else. Your previous understanding of the programs youâ€™re going to use. For me, it has taken several weeks to get an understanding of what IoT is, the physical structures and the software that is being used. But for an experienced individual, it would be much quicker. But it should be a quick project for a day if you know what you are doing.  

Objective: 
I chose this project because I believe it fit my lack of skill regarding IoT and programming. My limited knowledge of the subject and MicroPython made me humble to the available projects I could make at this time. But in the future I would like to build several temperature sensorsetups to put at chosen locations around the globe where I frequently visit. Getting funny reminders that itâ€™s time to go on vacation and enjoy life. For example, getting a message on the phone from Spain telling me that itâ€™s time to hit the beach. 

The project will give me insights about the temperature and humidity in the room of my choosing. Which, at the moment, is unknown to me. 


Material: 
Things used in this project. 

Hardware components: 
- Pycom - Lopy 4 - Four network. - Adds on to the expansionboard to access remote connection to other receivers. Such as WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa and Sigfox. 
- Pycom - Expansion board.
- Temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11). - Enables the device to receive information about temperature and humidity.
- 3 Wires - Connects the sensor to the expansionboard. 
- Pycom - Antannae. Connects to LoRa network. 



Software apps and online services: 
- Atom
- Pybytes

Computer Setup: 

Putting everything together: 

Story: 

This will be my first ever project in IoT. Iâ€™ve decided to try out to make a normal temperature meter for my first project. The device will then be connected to a dashboard to show the temperature. 

Step 1: 
Set up the physical board to create the base for the project: 
1. Attach the Lopy 4 to the Expansionboard. 
2. Update the Expansionboard and connect the physical setup to Pybytes. 
    Download the installer, setup wifi etc. 


Step 2: 
Attach the sensor to the expansionboard: 
1. 
- Green wire for Data. Far left point of the sensor to P23 of the expansionboard. 
- Red wire for power. Middle point of the sensor to 3V3 on the expansionboard. 
- Black wire for grounding. Far right point of the sensor to GND on the expansionboard. 
  

Step 3: 
Download Atom.

Attach the example code from GitHub to Atom.
Adapt it to my project for showing temperature and humidity.
